# Random Rogue-Like Genre Map Template Generator

The purpose of this project was to build a script/tool in Unity for developers to create their own 2D rogue-like genre levels. Using this generator, all developers have to do is replace 
the placeholder sprites/tiles with sprites/tiles of their own and they'd have their own rogue-like genre level in their own art style! Additionally, developers will also have the option to alter the size and number of generated rooms within the Unity inspector-view of the generator script itself. 

# ***INSERT PICTURES OF PLACEHOLDER TEMPLATES HERE***

The pictures above are examples of generated template levels using placeholder tiles/sprites.

# ***INSERT PICTURES OF CUSTOM SPRITE/TILE LEVELS HERE***

The pictures above are examples of level generations that have swapped the placeholder sprites/tiles with custom sprites/tiles.
